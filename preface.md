# Preface

Other than the sky and some trees, everything I can see from where I now sit is
artificial.

Virtually all urban sensual experience has been touched by human hands, and thus the vast majority of us experience the physical world, at least, as altered through the process of design.

Given that so much of our perception involves made things, it is reasonable to ask how they got to look the way they do. How is it that an artifact of technology has one shape rather than another?

If form does not follow function in any deterministic way, then by what mechanism do the shapes and forms of our made world come to be?

This extended essay, which may be read as a refutation of the design dictum that “form follows function,” has led to considerations that go beyond things themselves to the roots of the often inegable creative processes of invention and design.

As artifacts evolve from artifacts, so do books from books.
