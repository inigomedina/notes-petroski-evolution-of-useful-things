# Form follows failure

But whereas the shortcomings of an existing thing may be expressed in terms of a
need for improvement, it is really want rather than need that drives the process of technological evolution. Thus we may need air and water, but generally we do not require air conditioning or ice water in any fundamental way. We may ɹnd food indispensable, but it is not necessary to eat it with a fork. Luxury, rather than necessity, is the mother of invention. Every artifact is somewhat wanting in its function, and this is what drives its evolution.

Here, then, is the central idea: the form of made things is always subject to change in response to their real or perceived shortcomings, their failures to function properly.This principle governs all invention, innovation, and ingenuity; it is what drives all inventors, innovators, and engineers.

Since nothing is perfect, and, indeed, since even our ideas of perfection are not static, **everything is subject to change over time**. There can be no such thing as a “perfected” artifact; the future perfect can only be a tense, not a thing.

Rather, the objective here is to celebrate the clever and everyday things of an imperfect world as triumphs in the face of design adversity.

Few writers have been more explicit about the role of failure in the evolution of artifacts than the architect Christopher Alexander in his Notes on the Synthesis of Form.
