# How the Fork Got Its Tines

The eating utensils that we use daily are as familiar to us as our own hands.

Did they appear in some ɻash of genius to one of our ancestors, who yelled “Eureka!,” or did they evolve as naturally and quietly as did the parts of our bodies?

Are our eating utensils really “perfected,” or is there room for improvement?

Such questions that arise out of table talk can serve as paradigms for questions about the origins and evolution of all made things. 

Delving into the evolution of the knife, fork, and spoon can lead us to a theory of how all the things of technology evolve. 

Frustrations with knives, especially their shortcomings in holding meat steady for cutting, led to the development of the fork.

It is believed that forks were used for dining in the royal courts of
the Middle East as early as the seventh century and reached Italy around the year 1100. However, they did not come into any signiɹcant service there until about the fourteenth century.

Not until the seventeenth century did the fork appear in England. Thomas Coryate, an Englishman who traveled in France, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany in 1608, published three years later an account of his adventures in a book entitled, in part, Crudities Hastily Gobbled Up in Five Months. At that time, when a large piece of meat was set on a table in England, the diners were still expected to partake of this main dish by slicing of a portion each while holding the roast steady with the ɹngers of their free hand. Coryate saw it done differently in Italy.

Forks spread slowly in England, for the utensil was much ridiculed as “an eʃeminate piece of ɹnery,” according to the historian of inventions John Beckmann.

Putting aside acceptance and custom, what makes the fork work, of course, are its tines. But how many tines make the best fork, and why?

If three tines were an improvement, then four were even better. By the early
eighteenth century, in Germany, four-tined forks looked as they do today, and by the end of the nineteenth century the four-tined dinner fork became the standard in England. There have been five- and six-tined forks, but four appears to be the optimum.

The modern table knife and fork have evolved through a kind of symbiotic
relationship, but the general form of the spoon has developed more or less
independently.

It is reasonable to assume that the cupped hand was the ɹrst spoon, but we all know how ineɽcient it can be. 

The use of the knife, fork, and spoon in late-seventeenth- and early-eighteenthcentury Europe has inɻuenced some persistent diʃerences in their use by Europeans and Americans today.

By the eighteenth century, the European style of using utensils had become somewhat standardized, with the knife in the right hand cutting oʃ food and sometimes also pushing pieces of it onto the fork, which conveyed it to the mouth.

But the fork was a rare item in colonial America.

In the Far East, chopsticks developed about ɹve thousand years ago as extensions of the fingers. According to one theory of their origin, food was cooked in large pots, which held the heat long after everything was ready to be eaten.

The evolution of eating utensils provides a strong paradigm for the evolution of
artifacts generally.
